As your Gravity Forms ecosystem grows, the default list view becomes difficult to manage.

- Speeds up editing, reviewing, and form management
- Helps categorize forms by client, project, campaign, or workflow
- Simplifies complex WordPress operations environments
- Improves onboarding for new team members
- Supports multi-team form management without confusion
- Reduces admin clutter when working with large Gravity Forms libraries
- Mirrors real-world organizational structures
- Prevents losing track of forms and views in long unorganized lists

### Use Cases

- Agencies managing many client installations
- Ops teams using Gravity Forms for intake, tracking, CRM, or internal workflows
- Nonprofits running multi-program form structures
- Enterprise WordPress environments with departmental forms
- Multisite networks maintaining separate sets of forms and views

- Internal teams organizing form-based tasks, workflows, and campaigns
- High-volume GravityView installations with large sets of Views
- Sites needing a visual structure for form libraries at scale

### Productivity Boosts

Folders4Gravity is built to reduce friction and accelerate daily admin tasks:

- Quickly switch between forms grouped by folder
- Organize views by project, team, or workflow
- Add items into the correct folder quickly and easily

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `folders4gravity` plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Forms → Form Folders** to begin creating folders and organizing your Gravity Forms.
4. If you have GravityView installed, go to **GravityKit → View Folders** to organize your Views.
5. Start creating folders and assigning forms or views using drag-and-drop or bulk actions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
### Does Folders4Gravity change anything about how my forms or views work?
No. Folders4Gravity is 100% admin-side only. It does not modify form settings, IDs, entries, confirmations, notifications, or front-end display. It simply provides a clean, structured folder interface to organize Gravity Forms and GravityView items.

### How do I create my first folder?
After activating the plugin, go to **Forms → Form Folders** or **GravityKit → View Folders** (if GravityView is installed). Click “Add Folder,” name it, and start dragging your forms or views into place. You can also bulk-assign items to new or existing folders.

### Can I drag and drop forms into folders?
Yes. Drag-and-drop is fully supported for both folders and items. You can reorder folders, reorder the forms inside them, and reorganize your workspace instantly.

### Can I bulk assign multiple forms or views to a folder?
Yes. Use the bulk selector to choose several items at once and assign them to a folder with a single action. This works for both Gravity Forms and GravityView Views.

### Does Folders4Gravity support GravityView?
Yes. If GravityView is installed, the plugin automatically adds a parallel folder system under **GravityKit → View Folders** so you can organize Views by project, workflow, client, or campaign without any setup.

### Will this help me manage a large number of forms?
Absolutely. Folders4Gravity is designed for sites with large Gravity Forms libraries, multi-team environments, agencies, and multisite installations. It reduces admin clutter, speeds up navigation, and provides a structured dashboard for high-volume form management.

### Can I reorder folders and items?
Yes. Both folders and the items inside them support drag-and-drop ordering. You can maintain a custom hierarchy that mirrors your organizational structure—client, project, department, or workflow.

### Will this help organize GravityView Views for client or project work?
Yes. You can group Views by client, project, team, or campaign, making it much easier to navigate complex GravityView setups.

### Does this plugin affect front-end performance?
No. All folder operations occur in the WordPress admin and do not affect front-end performance or user-facing behavior.

### Does this plugin require configuration?
No configuration is required. Install, activate, and start creating folders immediately. Folders4Gravity integrates seamlessly with the existing Gravity Forms and GravityView admin pages.

### Will Folders4Gravity work on a multisite?
Yes. It improves form and view organization across multisite environments and is lightweight enough for large networks.

### Is this plugin useful for agencies or internal operations teams?
Yes. Agencies and internal teams benefit from folder-based organization that reduces clutter, supports multi-team workflows, and keeps form structures clear for everyone involved.

### Does it support one-click shortcode copying?
Yes. You can copy the form shortcode directly from the folder view for faster implementation in your WordPress pages.

### Does each item have to belong to a folder?
No—placing forms or views in folders is optional. Unassigned items remain visible in the default list until you move them.

### Does deleting a folder delete my forms or views?
No. Deleting a folder only removes the folder container. All your forms and views remain untouched and return to the main list.

### Is this plugin lightweight?
Yes. Folders4Gravity is intentionally lightweight, fast, and optimized for large and complex Gravity Forms setups.
